# Preparation

This converter uses FFMPEG for MP3 and MP4 Files, to make this work, go download FFMPEG at
https://www.ffmpeg.org/
and extract it to this folder

# Usage

1. Put all music into a folder named 'Music'
2. To normalize volume levels, copy Normalize.bat and Normalize.exe to Music and run Normalize.bat (doing this without copying is still in the works)
3. To convert MP3 files to something usable, copy FFMPEG.bat and FFMPEG.exe to the music folder and run FFMPEG.bat
4. To convert all FLAC, WAV and OGG files to PCM, run converter.py
