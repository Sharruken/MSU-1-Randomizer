# MSU-1-Randomizer

This is a randomizer to be used with any and all MSU-1 patched SNES games.

# MSU-1 Randomizer Usage

1. Place all .pcm files in the music folder
2. Run 'Music Randomizer.py'
3. Follow the instructions in the prompt
4. If needed, patch the ROM in the Output folder with the relevant patch from the Patches folder (this is still being expanded)
5. Run your ROM with Retroarch's Snes9x Core, or the latest version of Snes9x (if requested, I'll gather files for the few other emulators that work for MSU-1 and the SD2SNES files)
