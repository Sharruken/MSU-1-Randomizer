# MSU-1 Randomizer Usage

1. Place all .pcm files in the music folder

4. If needed, patch the ROM in the Output folder with the relevant patch from the Patches folder (this is still being expanded)
5. Run your ROM with Retroarch's Snes9x Core, or the latest version of Snes9x (if requested, I'll gather files for the few other emulators that work for MSU-1 and the SD2SNES files)
